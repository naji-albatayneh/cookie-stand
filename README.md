# LAB - 06: Get started on the Salmon Cookies project

## Project Name: cookie-stand

I build a web app with a direct and powerful purpose entitled "cookie-stand". It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. It uses objects and functions in JS to calculate daily Avg. total of cookies in all locations of the shop.
